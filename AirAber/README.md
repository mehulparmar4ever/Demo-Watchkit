#  AirAber Demo

## watchOS Tutorial

This is the iOS app: it doesn't do anything.

You'll add a Watch app to list information about Air Aber flights, and let the user check in.

The Shared group contains files that the Watch app will use.

- Create the Flight interface.
- Add label, group, button, table in controller & use it
- Get data from json file and display it in view
